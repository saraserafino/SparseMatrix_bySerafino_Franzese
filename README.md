# Implementation of a Sparse Matrix class

Development by Saverio Franzese and Sara Serafino of the first project of the course Advanced Programming that can be found [here](https://github.com/pcafrica/advanced_programming_2023-2024/blob/main/homeworks/homework_01.md).

## Description
A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. There are several efficient ways to store a sparse matrix; this project will implement the Coordinate (COO) and Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) formats.

## Code organization
The folder called include containes the header files, the folder called src contains the source files and the main.

## How to compile
A build.sh is provided, thus write from the terminal the following two commands:
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./build.sh
```
If the build is successful, you can run the program using `./build/HomeworkSF`
